h3. Version 2.0.0 (May 23, 2012)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>pipes</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

* @GatherPipe@ no longer locks on looping and is semantically sound for depth-first traversing
* Added @GatherFunctionPipe@ for user provided function to transform the gathered list
* Added @Pipe.enablePath(boolean)@ method to support the turning on/off of path calculations (efficiency reasons)
* Renamed @Pipe.getPath()@ to @Pipe.getCurrentPath()@
* @SideEffectCapPipe@ moved to the @transform@ package as it was wrongly organized in the @sideeffect@ package
* Fixed an indexing issue in @ExhaustMergePipe@ that made itself apparent when two split/merges happened in the same pipeline
* Added @Tree@ and @TreePipe@ to return a tree representation of a traversal
* Merged @PathPipe@ and @PathFunctionPipe@ into one class called @PathPipe@
* Added @AbstractMetaPipe@ to encapsulate reused behavior in all @MetaPipe@ implementations
* The @CopySplitPipe@, @FairMergePipe@, and @ExhaustMergePipe@ all have functioning path calculations
* Removed unused extra methods for merging in @PipesFluentPipeline@ interface (and updated respective implementations)
* Added @OrderPipe@ to do inline sorting of objects in a stream
* Added numerous help methods to the @Table@ data structure

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>pipes</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

* Added @SelectPipe@ to select the objects of named steps from a pipeline
* Separated @Row@ from @Table@ so it can be reused by other pipes (e.g. @SelectPipe@)
* Heavily reworked @PipesFluentPipeline@ JavaDoc to make it a single point of reference
* Updated @LoopPipe@ semantics such that if there is an emit function, then the final object in a while isn't returned
* Updated @GroupCountFunctionPipe@ semantics such that the value-function gets a @Pair@ containing incoming object and last value for that object
* Reorganized the @com.tinkerpop.pipes.util@ package
* Removed the @objectFilter@ step from @PipeFluentPipeline@ as @retain@ and @except@ can be used instead
* @EmptyIterator@ is now a singleton
* @ScatterPipe@ now scatters @Map@ objects into @Map.Entry@ streams
* Added @GroupByPipe@ which groups values under a provided key
* Added @GroupByReducePipe@ which groups reduced values under a provided key

* @GroupCountFunctionPipe@ has signature of @<S,K>@ to denote the key of its @Map<K,Number>@ side-effect

* Added @PipeHelper.iterate()@ to complete drain an iterator
* Added @FluentPipeline@ as a utility class for fluently constructing a pipeline

* Simplified the semantics of @HasNextPipe@ (use @Pipe.hasNext()@ to accomplish previous behavior)
* Added @MemoizePipe@ to memoize the mapping of a particular pipe
* Simplified @PipeClosure@ to be purely functional and now named @PipeFunction@
** Renamed @XXXClosurePipe@ to @XXXFunctionPipe@
* Fixed performance issue in @RangeFilterPipe@ and provided @long@ ranges
